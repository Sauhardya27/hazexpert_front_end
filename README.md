# What is HazeXpert? 

HazeXpert is a software that works on an AIML-based De-hazing and De-smoking algorithm which enables the firefighters to see clearer through the smoke, resulting in faster response time. Since every second is valuable in such situations, a faster response could effectively save someoneâ€™s life.
After dehazing individual frames of the video, the  frames are then stitched together to form a video again.  This output video now contains a clearer view, without  the fog/smoke. There is a significant time delay since  the image processing is not done on the device, but  sent to a server. We have used the Stable Diffusion  model to train and finetune our model. For the image  dataset, we have used two versions of every image -  one clear and another hazy/smoky.
Different from traditional math operations-based tools and quite time-consuming methods, HazeXpert excels at handling real details with deep learning.
