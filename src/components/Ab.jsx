HazeXpert enables the firefighters to see clearer through thr smoke, resulting in faster response time. Since every second is valuable in situations like these , a faster response could effectively save someoneâ€™s life.

			<p className={`${styles.paragraph} max-w-[750px] mt-10`}>After dehazing individual frames of the video, the  frames are then stitched together to form a video again.  This output video now contains a clearer view, without  the fog / smoke. There is a significant time delay since  the image processing is not done on the device, but  sent to a server.We have used the Stable Diffusion  model to train and finetune our model. For the image  dataset, we have used two versions of every image -  one clear and another hazy/smoky.
Different from traditional math operations-based tools and quite time consuming methods, HazeXpert excels at handling real details with deep learning.
